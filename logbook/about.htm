The South Carolina Aviation Medal (S.C.A.M.) is an original aviation art 
medallion commissioned to broadly promote aviation in the State of South
Carolina and across the southeastern region of the United States.  It is 
intended that the medal be flown by aircraft owners and pilots in the 
course of their normal flying routine and handed off in sequence to other 
pilots to continue its journey of promoting aviation and sport flying 
throughout the region.  Further, its accompanying logbook and the S.C.A.M.
website are provided so that pilots may document the flight they share
with the medallion.

As the medal passes from hand to hand, pilots are encouraged to annotate
the log book appropriately and in detail and to update the website
accordingly.  We should always know the answer to the question: "Where is
the S.C.A.M.?"

Rules:
+ The S.C.A.M. is to be kept in the general region of the southeastern 
   United States
+ Pilots receiving the S.C.A.M. are encouraged to "move it on" within 72 
   hours of receipt
+ Pilots will annotate the S.C.A.M. Log Book with all pertinent details of
   the flight(s) they completed with the S.C.A.M., including names, locations,
   aircraft N-numbers, maneuvers involved, etc. and the name of the pilot and 
   the N-number of the aircraft to whom they passed it on
+ Receiving pilots will check the status of the attached S.C.A.M. GPS and if
   the batteries are low, it will be your 'privilege' to install new ones
+ Any pilot holding the S.C.A.M. on a Sunday on which a South Carolina Breakfast
   Club event is held will make every effort to fly the S.C.A.M. to that event
   so that the orther regional pilots may catch up on what the S.C.A.M. has
   been up to
+ Flights which feature imaginative and unusual flying, exotic destinations,
   and other variations common to the great sport of aviation are fully 
   encouraged
+ All flihts must be fully documented in the S.C.A.M. Log Book for the 
   edification of all
+ A separate objective of the S.C.A.M. is to touch down at every airport 
   in the region and eventually, to fly with as many pilots and aircraft 
   at each as possible
+ The S.C.A.M. website will be continuously updated with the whereabouts
   of the S.C.A.M. along with other pertinent and related S.C.A.M. information
