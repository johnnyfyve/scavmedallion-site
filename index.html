				<h2>What is the South Carolina Aviation Medallion?</h2>
				<span class="byline"><p>The “S.C.A.M.” is an original, aviation art medallion commissioned to help promote and celebrate aviation in the State of South Carolina and across the southeastern region of the United States.</p><p>It is intended that the medal be flown by aircraft owners and pilots in the course of their normal flying routines and be handed off to other pilots to continue its journey of promoting aviation and sport flying throughout the region.</p><p>Its accompanying logbook and website allow pilots to document the flights they share with the medallion.</p><p>As the medallion passes from hand to hand, pilots are encouraged to annotate the Logbook appropriately and to update the website accordingly. This is the only way we will always know the answer to the question: "Where is the Medallion?"</p>
